Fig. 1(a\u2013d) shows typical powder diffraction patterns corresponding to CHA-structure of SAPO-34 where intensity and peak position of each peak match well with that of reported for SAPO-34 material without any presence of impurity phases [13]. However, with increase of TEAOH ratio from 0 to 1.5, a decrease in peak intensityandline broadeningisobservedasisseenfromFig.1(a\u2013 d). Based on XRD peak intensity of peak appearing at 2u = 22.58, the crystallinity of SAPO-34 phase is determined and found to be 71.6%, 48.4% and 25.1%, respectively. When TEAOH is only used as a template agent without using morpholine, the crystalline phase of as synthesized sample is found to be signi\ufb01cantly different as is seen in Fig. 1(e). Major product is SAPO-5 (92%) with presence of minor one, i.e. SAPO-34 (8%). Although the TEAOH is a good template agent for the synthesis of SAPO-34 [14], SAPO-5 instead of SAPO-34 is obtained as a major crystal phase due to high Si content and/or our existing experimental conditions [15].

When the mixture is used for the synthesis of SAPO-34, the crystal size is decreased to sub-micrometer size and the morphology of the crystal is changed to spherical type formed by aggregation of nano-sized crystals. All the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts show similar activity and product distribution in the MTO reaction. However, the catalyst obtained using the mixture of 75% morpholine and 25% TEAOH has the longest lifetime. The lifetime is increased by \ufb01ve times compared to that of the catalyst synthesized with 100% morpholine.
