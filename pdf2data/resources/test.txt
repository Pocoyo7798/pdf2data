Abstract

Effects of templating on the catalytic performance of SAPO-34 catalyst have been investigated in conversion of methanol to oleﬁns (MTO).
SAPO-34 catalysts were synthesized using a single agent or a mixture of morpholine or tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide of (TEAOH) as the
template during synthesis of gel with nominal composition as 1Al2O3:1P2O5:0.6SiO2:x morpholine:(2 (cid:2) x)TEAOH:52H2O. Compared with using
single template, using a mixed template leads to the particle size reduction and the morphology change to spherical type formed by the aggregation
of nano-sized crystals. Although all the catalysts showed similar activity and product distribution in the MTO reaction, the catalyst obtained using
the mixture of 75% morpholine and 25% TEAOH gave the longest lifetime.

1. Introduction

Small pore silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve, SAPO-
34 is well known to be one of the best catalysts in the conversion
of methanol to oleﬁns (MTO) [1–6]. It gives a very high
selectivity (>80%) to light oleﬁns (C2–C4) with almost 100%
conversion of methanol, which is mainly attributed to its mild
acidity and shape selective catalysis by small pore entrance.
However, the main problem associated with these catalysts is
rapid deactivation of SAPO-34 due to coke formation during
MTO reaction [7–11] and this resultantly makes the lifetime of
these catalysts short. Although the catalysts are regenerated by
hot-air blowing, loss of carbon can not be avoided. Therefore, it
is necessary to develop the catalysts which are more resistant to
coke formation. Considering these facts, in the present work,
SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared with mixed templating
agents and their catalytic activity, selectivity and stability were
examined in the MTO reaction. The performance parameter of
SAPO-34 catalysts, namely catalyst stability was found to be
affected by the preparation parameters during synthesis which

are closely related with crystal size and the silicon contents
during synthesis. All of these results related to synthesis and
characterization are presented in this paper.

2. Experimental

2.1. Catalyst preparation

The

(SAPO) molecular

silicoaluminophosphate

sieve
catalysts were synthesized hydrothermally using the mixtures
of morpholine and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH)
as templating agent via a suitable modiﬁcation of the reported
method [12]. The molar composition for synthesis of the
catalysts was kept as 1.0Al2O3:1.0P2O5:0.6SiO2:x morpholi-
ne:(2.0 (cid:2) x)TEAOH: 52H2O (x = 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0).
The synthesis procedure followed for gel preparation in typical
experiment with x = 1.0 is described as given below.

14.16 g of pseudoboehmite (catapal A, 74.2% Al2O3, Vista
chemicals) was added to 25 mL of water, and then mixture of
23.06 g of phosphoric acid (85%, Samchun chemicals) and
1.8 mL of water was added to the alumina solution under
stirring by a drop-wise addition for 2 h and then the resulting
solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Clear silica
solution was further added, which was prepared by dissolution

131

of 9.01 g of colloidal silica (Ludox As-40, 40% SiO2) into
42.09 g of 35% TEAOH aqueous solution (Aldrich) at 100 8C
for 12 h by stirring. Finally, 8.71 g of morpholine (Aldrich) and
12 mL of water was added and the resulting mixture was stirred
for 25 h. The resulting gel mass was transferred into autoclave
and heated in two steps of 120 and 200 8C and maintained for
12 h at each temperature with vigorous stirring. The solid
product was recovered by centrifugation, washed several times
with distilled water and dried overnight at 120 8C. As-
synthesized product was then calcined in air at 550 8C.

2.2. Characterization

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-
synthesized catalysts were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX IIIB
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiations. The morphology of
the samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope
(Philips XL 30S FEG microscope). The surface acidity of the
catalysts was measured by temperature programmed desorption
of ammonia (NH3-TPD) using a BEL-CAT TPD analyzer with
TCD detector. In a typical analysis, 0.2 g of the calcined sample
was pretreated to remove adsorbed water at 500 8C for 3 h and
then saturated with ammonia at 100 8C for 1 h. After saturation,
the sample was purged with helium for 30 min to remove the
weakly adsorbed ammonia on the surface of the catalyst. The
temperature of the sample was then raised at a heating rate 10 8C/
min from 100 to 700 8C. The amount of ammonia desorbed from
the catalyst was measured by comparing the TPD areas with that
for standard sample. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and
differential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed to detect the
thermal decomposition of amine templates of as-synthesized
catalysts using TA Instrument (DMA, SDT 2960) under an air
ﬂow (100 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 8C/min from room
temperature up to 800 8C. The BET surface areas of calcined
samples were determined from isotherm data of nitrogen
adsorption–desorption obtained at (cid:2)196 8C using Micromeritics
ASAP-2400 analyzer. Elemental analysis for Al, P and Si of
calcined samples was done by inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, ULTIMC, Jobin Yvon
Inc.) after dissolving the samples into 1N HNO3 solution.

2.3. Catalytic reaction

The conversion reactions of methanol to oleﬁns were carried
out in a ﬁxed bed down ﬂow micro-reactor and at atmospheric
pressure and in the temperature range of 250–500 8C. A known
weight (0.489 g) of calcined SAPO catalyst (20–50 mesh) was
packed in the center of stainless steel (i.d.: 1 cm, length: 30 cm)
reactor and heated by a tubular furnace. Methanol with a liquid
ﬂow rate of 0.01 mL/min was fed by syringe pump into a
preheater kept at 300 8C. Helium was used as an inert diluent
gas and co-fed with methanol into the reactor at a ﬂow rate of
60 mL/min and the ratio of methanol: He was maintained to
1:10.89 in vol.%, where space velocity in WHSV was kept to
1 h(cid:2)1. The analysis of the reaction products was performed
using an on-line gas chromatograph (Donam GC 6100)
equipped with ﬂame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity

(TCD) detector with Gas-Pro and Plot-Q capillary columns for
hydrocarbons and oxygenates, respectively.

3. Result and discussions

3.1. Characterization

Fig. 1 shows X-ray diffraction patterns of as-synthesized
SAPO samples prepared by mixed template method. Fig. 1(a–d)
shows typical powder diffraction patterns corresponding to
CHA-structure of SAPO-34 where intensity and peak position of
each peak match well with that of reported for SAPO-34 material
without any presence of impurity phases [13]. However, with
increase of TEAOH ratio from 0 to 1.5, a decrease in peak
intensity and line broadening is observed as is seen from Fig. 1(a–
d). Based on XRD peak intensity of peak appearing at 2u = 22.58,
the crystallinity of SAPO-34 phase is determined and found to be
71.6%, 48.4% and 25.1%, respectively.

When TEAOH is only used as a template agent without
using morpholine,
the crystalline phase of as synthesized
sample is found to be signiﬁcantly different as is seen in
Fig. 1(e). Major product is SAPO-5 (92%) with presence of
minor one, i.e. SAPO-34 (8%). Although the TEAOH is a good
template agent for the synthesis of SAPO-34 [14], SAPO-5
instead of SAPO-34 is obtained as a major crystal phase due to
high Si content and/or our existing experimental conditions
[15]. It was also observed that the reduction in Si content during
synthesis of gel to half under the same synthesis conditions led
to the formation of only pure SAPO-34 phase. Table 1 presents
the summary of preparation conditions and phase data, based on
the XRD results, of the SAPO samples prepared using mixed
template.

The results of ICP-AES analyses and surface area data are
given in Table 2 for the as-synthesized samples. Compared to Si/
(Al + P + Si) = 0.130 for all starting gels, the ratio of the product
samples was found to be higher than 0.146 after crystallization,
which means more amounts of Si was incorporated into the
framework of SAPO molecular sieves and/or remained as
amorphous silica phase on extra-framework. The Si content in

the product samples also gradually increases with increase of
TEAOH content in the synthesis gel. When we compare the XRD
data of Fig. 1, it is clear that the parts of Si most probably remain
in extra-framework as amorphous phase in M15, M10, and M5
samples and this inference was conﬁrmed by NH3 TPD data,
which is discussed later in detail. M20 sample synthesized
without TEAOH showed lowest and steep decrease in Si content
compared to other TEAOH containing samples.

Table 2 also shows the BET surface area data of the samples
measured by nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiment. The
surface area decreased from 772 to 284 m2/g when TEAOH
content increased from x = 0 to x = 2.0 during the synthesis of
gel. Gradual decrease in the surface area was observed in the
range of TEAOH from x = 0 to x = 1.5. This observation

strongly suggests that the sample partially lost its crystallinity,
and it became amorphous with increasing TEAOH. This
observation is consistent with XRD results discussed earlier
where crystallinity is found to be decreased with increasing
TEAOH ratio. The steep decrease in surface area was observed
in the sample (M0) when x is changed from 1.5 to 2.0 in
TEAOH content. This may be possibly be related to the change
in crystal phase from CHA- to AFI-type molecular sieve.
Generally CHA-type molecular sieve has larger BET surface
area than ones with AFI [16].

Fig. 2 shows SEM images for as-synthesized samples. M20
sample in Fig. 2(a) exhibits the rhombohedral shape of typical
SAPO-34 with average particle size of 5–20 mm, which is
typical when morpholine is used as a template agent [17]. M15

sample, however, shows spherical aggregates of nano-sized
cube type SAPO-34 crystals where the aggregates showed
average crystal size of 1 mm with homogeneous size distri-
bution. M10 as-synthesized sample (with morpholine and
TEAOH in equal amounts) shows irregular shape in morpho-
logy with crystal size in sub-micrometer range. The M5 sample
shows very interesting morphology where the surface of
spherical shaped particle was aggregated with SAPO-34 nano-
crystals. On the other hand, M0 sample shows hexagonal type
crystal habit which is typical SAPO-5 morphology. Thus, the
SEM study conﬁrms that morphology of the ﬁnal product is
dependent on the nature of template used during synthesis.

Fig. 3 shows TGA/DTA curves for all the synthesized
samples. TGA/DTA results for M20, M15, M10 and M5
samples showed similar weight loss pattern in the temperature
ranges of 25–100, 100–450 and 450–800 8C. The ﬁrst weight
loss, accompanied with endothermic peak appearing in DTA
curve,
is attributable to the physically adsorbed water
associated with SAPO samples. The second weight loss in
TGA curve centered at around 410–460 8C, accompanied with
strong exothermic DTA peak, is attributed to the oxidative
decomposition of organic templates. The third weight loss in
TGA curve centered at around 550 8C, accompanied with weak
broad exothermic DTA peak, may be related to the oxidation of
organic templates also. The third weight
loss increased
gradually with increase of morpholine content in the samples
from sample M5 to M20, which is related due to the loss of
template trapped at ion-exchange site within CHA cage of
SAPO-34 [17]. M0 sample synthesized using TEAOH only,
which showed a major phase of SAPO-5, exhibited weight losses
in three stages. The ﬁrst stage is assigned to the desorption of
water and the second stage with endothermic peak at around
300 8C to the desorption of TEAOH and the last at temperature
ranged from 370 to 800 8C is attributed to the oxidative
decomposition of TEAOH in the sample. The TGA/DTA study
indicated that complete decomposition of template occurs at
temperatures greater than 550 8C hence the calcination was
carried at the said temperature during the present investigation.
TPD of ammonia was used to characterize the acidic
properties of SAPO samples and curves obtained for the same
are shown in Fig. 4. Two TPD peaks for SAPO-34 samples at

temperatures 200 and 430 8C were observed. They are in
accordance with the reported literature data for the acidity of
SAPO materials [18]. Total ammonia amount desorbed are
narrowly ranged to ca. 1.0 mmol/g for the SAPO-34 samples.
The intensity of high temperature desorption peak appearing at
430 8C assigned to the strong acidic sites which are generated
by the incorporation of silicon into the framework of SAPO
molecular sieve, decreased with increase of TEAOH in the
order of M20 > M15 > M10 > M5 > M0. Low temperature
peak at ca. 200 8C, assigned to the weak acid sites which are
probably Bro¨nsted acid sites originating from P-OH groups not
fully linked to AlO4 tetrahedra [18], showed no apparent
difference in peak intensity with TEAOH amounts. Peak
intensity of high temperature desorption peak decreased with
increase of TEAOH amount whereas Si content in product
samples increased with TEAOH amount as shown in ICP-AES
results of Table 2, which means that some part of Si in M15,
M10 and M5 samples could exist as amorphous silica in extra-
framework of SAPO samples and its amount could also be
increased in proportion to TEAOH amount. This observation is
also supported by XRD data in Fig. 1, where it exhibited
gradual decrease in XRD peak intensity for SAPO-34 with
higher TEAOH amount. Fig. 4(e) shows NH3-TPD pattern for
M0 sample. A very weak desorption peak in high temperature

region compared to SAPO-34 samples and strong peak at low
acidity region were observed, which is similar to typical ones of
SAPO-5 sample reported in literature [19].

3.2. Activity test for MTO reaction

Fig. 5 shows the product distribution for methanol conversion
reaction on M15 sample as a function reaction temperature. For
every reaction temperature, the fresh catalyst was loaded to
collect the reaction data. The measurements of yield of reaction
products in Fig. 5 correspond to a time-on-stream (TOS) of 1 h at
each temperature. At 250 8C methanol was converted mostly to
dimethylether (DME) with ca. 80% yield as an intermediate
product. As the temperature increased from 300 to 500 8C, the
MeOH conversion became complete and yield of light oleﬁns
(ethylene, propylene and butenes) was signiﬁcant and became
more than 80%, whereas yield of saturated hydrocarbon was
maintained less than 10% in whole reaction temperature. With
further increase of reaction temperature, C4 oleﬁns gave
maximum value of about 20% at 300 8C, which gradually
decreased with increasing temperature. In the case of propylene,
the yield increased with increasing temperature up to 400 8C
afterward decreased at 500 8C, whereas yield of ethylene steadily
increased in the whole reaction temperature. The reason for this
phenomenon is that propylene and butenes can oligomerize to
bigger oligomers, which crack to form ethylene at higher
temperature. That is why yields of propylene and butenes have
maximum values at low or medium temperature, while the yield
of ethylene steadily increases with reaction temperature. The
ethylene to propylene molar ratio increased from 0.71 at 300 8C
to 1.77 at 500 8C. Yield of oleﬁns has maximum value at 450 8C
and decreases at 500 8C with increase of yield of saturated
hydrocarbon (mainly, methane).

Fig. 6 shows the yield of products with TOS on M15 at
450 8C. The yield of light oleﬁns was maintained over 90%
until catalytic activity abruptly decreased by deactivation of
catalyst. Catalyst deactivation on MTO reaction would mainly
be preceded by coke formation. The coke would cover acidic
sites and also block the pore of SAPO-34. SAPO-34 has CHA

cage (7.5 A˚ (cid:3) 8.2 A˚ ) enough to accommodate coke or coke
precursor.

Before catalyst deactivation the yield of ethylene increased
with TOS and accompanied the concomitant decrease of
propylene. The DME yield in the product steeply increased
with start of catalyst deactivation and reached a maximum of
80%. DME as a reaction intermediate can easily be converted to
oleﬁns in acidic sites until the cages are occupied by coke. Once
the cages are occupied by coke, yield of oleﬁns is abruptly
decreased [2]. However, even after deactivation of the catalyst
in reaction of methanol to oleﬁns, conversion reaction of
methanol to DME can take place on the weak acidic sites of
external surface of SAPO-34 because this reaction can occur at
weaker acidic sites than the reaction of methanol to oleﬁns. The
ethylene to propylene ratio reached a maximum of 1.81 just
before the deactivation, namely at 12 h of TOS.

Table 3 gives product distribution and lifetime of catalysts
on all the SAPO samples, which was measured in 1 h of TOS at
450 8C. All
these catalysts had complete conversion of
methanol and mostly conversion to light oleﬁns. When the
reaction was conducted to give partial conversion (84%) at
much lower temperature of 250 8C, yield of DME was 69.6%
while total yield of C2–C4 oleﬁns was merely 12.4%. Since the
comparison of selectivity of each sample in low conversion of
methanol would give mainly information about DME forma-
tion but little information about oleﬁn formation, we present the
data of product distribution under the condition which gives
mainly oleﬁns production. M20 catalyst, synthesized with
morpholine only, shows shortest catalyst lifetime (here we
deﬁned ‘catalyst lifetime’ as time sustaining catalyst activity
until total yield of C2–C4 oleﬁns exceeds 70%) and high yield in
saturated hydrocarbons. These results may be explained by
crystal size of M20 catalyst. Big crystal can bring diffusion
limitation for reactants and products especially in small pore
molecular sieve, which may result in coke formation and
subsequently deactivation of the catalyst [20]. Big crystal has
long intracrystalline diffusion length enough for the reaction
intermediates to react into coke which subsequently deactivate
the catalyst. On the other hand, when the big crystals of M20

sample were crushed into smaller crystals of about 1 mm by ball
milling, the lifetime of the catalyst increased with more than
three times compared with that of original sample. This
supports that catalyst lifetime strongly depends on crystal size
of SAPO-34. The strong acidity of M20 catalyst associated with
big crystal size promoted hydrogen transfer reaction of oleﬁns
to saturated hydrocarbons and aromatics, which are precursors
of coke formation. The catalysts, e.g. M15, M10 and M5
showed very similar product distributions with high yield in
light oleﬁns. However, there was large difference in catalyst
lifetime. The M15 catalyst maintained activity for 840 min
until total yield of C2–C4 oleﬁns maintains upper 70% (see
Fig. 7). The lifetime was in order of M15 > M10 > M5 >
M0 > M20. Crystal size of the samples decreases in order of
M20 > M15 > M10 as shown in SEM images of Fig. 2. We can
see that M5 sample consists of spheres of about 1 mm
aggregated with nanocrystals as shown in SEM images. This is
also supported by the broadness of XRD peaks in M5 sample.
Therefore, genuine crystal size decreases in order of M20 >
M15 > M10 > M5. In the case of M10 and M5 samples, they
have too short diffusion length for reaction intermediate to react
to oleﬁns. Thus longest lifetime of M15 with optimum crystal
size of about 1 mm can be explained by crystal size effect
because M20, M15, M10 and M5 samples have similar acidic
properties (Fig. 2, Table 2) and same crystal structure of CHA
topology.

On the other hand, crystallinity and speciﬁc surface area
decreased in order of M15 > M10 > M5 which may also be

related with the lifetime. M0 catalyst showed different product
distribution with relatively high yield in C4 and C3 oleﬁns
compared to other catalysts. M0 catalyst consists of the mixture
of SAPO-5 (92%) and SAPO-34 (8%). The SAPO-5 is large
pore molecular sieve with AFI topology where 1-D straight
channel consists of the 7.3 A˚ (cid:3) 7.3 A˚ pore entrance. Product
molecules in SAPO-5 can be easily escaped in the pore without
further reaction. Therefore, the yield of C3 and C4 oleﬁns in
SAPO-5 was higher as compared to SAPO-34. This result is
agreement with that reported in the literature [21].

Fig. 7 shows yield of light oleﬁns on TOS in all the catalysts.
All the catalysts except for M0 exhibited more than 90% yield in
the oleﬁns with abrupt decrease on TOS by catalyst deactivation.
Compared with other catalysts, M0 sample showed a slightly
lower yield in oleﬁns and a little slow decay in catalyst
diminishment which is due to larger pore and lower acidity.

4. Conclusions

The variety in morphology, crystal size and structure of
SAPO catalysts can be achieved by using a mixture of
morpholine and TEAOH as the template. When the mixture is
used for the synthesis of SAPO-34, the crystal size is decreased
to sub-micrometer size and the morphology of the crystal is
changed to spherical type formed by aggregation of nano-sized
crystals. All the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts show similar
activity and product distribution in the MTO reaction. However,
the catalyst obtained using the mixture of 75% morpholine and
25% TEAOH has the longest lifetime. The lifetime is increased
by ﬁve times compared to that of the catalyst synthesized with
100% morpholine.
