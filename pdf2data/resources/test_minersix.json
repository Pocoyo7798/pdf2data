        "Effects of templating on the catalytic performance of SAPO-34 catalyst have been investigated in conversion of methanol to ole\ufb01ns (MTO).SAPO-34 catalysts were synthesized using a single agent or a mixture of morpholine or tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide of (TEAOH) as thetemplate during synthesis of gel with nominal composition as 1Al2O3:1P2O5:0.6SiO2:x morpholine:(2 (cid:2) x)TEAOH:52H2O. Compared with usingsingle template, using a mixed template leads to the particle size reduction and the morphology change to spherical type formed by the aggregationof nano-sized crystals. Although all the catalysts showed similar activity and product distribution in the MTO reaction, the catalyst obtained usingthe mixture of 75% morpholine and 25% TEAOH gave the longest lifetime.# 2007 Elsevier B.V.

        "1. Introduction",
        "Small pore silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve, SAPO-34 is well known to be one of the best catalysts in the conversionof methanol to ole\ufb01ns (MTO) [1\u20136]. It gives a very highselectivity (>80%) to light ole\ufb01ns (C2\u2013C4) with almost 100%conversion of methanol, which is mainly attributed to its mildacidity and shape selective catalysis by small pore entrance.However, the main problem associated with these catalysts israpid deactivation of SAPO-34 due to coke formation duringMTO reaction [7\u201311] and this resultantly makes the lifetime ofthese catalysts short. Although the catalysts are regenerated byhot-air blowing, loss of carbon can not be avoided. Therefore, itis necessary to develop the catalysts which are more resistant tocoke formation. Considering these facts, in the present work,SAPO-34 catalysts were prepared with mixed templatingagents and their catalytic activity, selectivity and stability wereexamined in the MTO reaction. The performance parameter ofSAPO-34 catalysts, namely catalyst stability was found to beaffected by the preparation parameters during synthesis which",

        "The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-synthesized catalysts were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX IIIBX-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiations. The morphology ofthe samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope(Philips XL 30S FEG microscope). The surface acidity of thecatalysts was measured by temperature programmed desorptionof ammonia (NH3-TPD) using a BEL-CAT TPD analyzer withTCD detector. In a typical analysis, 0.2 g of the calcined samplewas pretreated to remove adsorbed water at 500 8C for 3 h andthen saturated with ammonia at 100 8C for 1 h. After saturation,the sample was purged with helium for 30 min to remove theweakly adsorbed ammonia on the surface of the catalyst. Thetemperature of the sample was then raised at a heating rate 10 8C/min from 100 to 700 8C. The amount of ammonia desorbed fromthe catalyst was measured by comparing the TPD areas with thatfor standard sample. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) anddifferential thermal analysis (DTA) were performed to detect thethermal decomposition of amine templates of as-synthesizedcatalysts using TA Instrument (DMA, SDT 2960) under an air\ufb02ow (100 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 8C/min from roomtemperature up to 800 8C. The BET surface areas of calcinedsamples were determined from isotherm data of nitrogenadsorption\u2013desorption obtained at (cid:2)196 8C using MicromeriticsASAP-2400 analyzer. Elemental analysis for Al, P and Si ofcalcined samples was done by inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, ULTIMC, Jobin YvonInc.) after dissolving the samples into 1N HNO3 solution.",

Fig. 1(a\u2013d)shows typical powder diffraction patterns corresponding toCHA-structure of SAPO-34 where intensity and peak position ofeach peak match well with that of reported for SAPO-34 materialwithout any presence of impurity phases [13]. However, withincrease of TEAOH ratio from 0 to 1.5, a decrease in peakintensity and line broadening is observed as is seen from Fig. 1(a\u2013d). Based on XRD peak intensity of peak appearing at 2u = 22.58,the crystallinity of SAPO-34 phase is determined and found to be71.6%, 48.4% and 25.1%, respectively.",
        "When TEAOH is only used as a template agent withoutusing morpholine,the crystalline phase of as synthesizedsample is found to be signi\ufb01cantly different as is seen inFig. 1(e). Major product is SAPO-5 (92%) with presence ofminor one, i.e. SAPO-34 (8%). Although the TEAOH is a goodtemplate agent for the synthesis of SAPO-34 [14], SAPO-5instead of SAPO-34 is obtained as a major crystal phase due tohigh Si content and/or our existing experimental conditions[15]. It was also observed that the reduction in Si content duringsynthesis of gel to half under the same synthesis conditions ledto the formation of only pure SAPO-34 phase.

        "strongly suggests that the sample partially lost its crystallinity,and it became amorphous with increasing TEAOH. Thisobservation is consistent with XRD results discussed earlierwhere crystallinity is found to be decreased with increasingTEAOH ratio. The steep decrease in surface area was observedin the sample (M0) when x is changed from 1.5 to 2.0 inTEAOH content. This may be possibly be related to the changein crystal phase from CHA- to AFI-type molecular sieve.Generally CHA-type molecular sieve has larger BET surfacearea than ones with AFI [16].",

        "Fig. 3 shows TGA/DTA curves for all the synthesizedsamples. TGA/DTA results for M20, M15, M10 and M5samples showed similar weight loss pattern in the temperatureranges of 25\u2013100, 100\u2013450 and 450\u2013800 8C. The \ufb01rst weightloss, accompanied with endothermic peak appearing in DTAcurve,is attributable to the physically adsorbed waterassociated with SAPO samples. The second weight loss inTGA curve centered at around 410\u2013460 8C, accompanied withstrong exothermic DTA peak, is attributed to the oxidativedecomposition of organic templates. The third weight loss inTGA curve centered at around 550 8C, accompanied with weakbroad exothermic DTA peak, may be related to the oxidation oforganic templates also. The third weightloss increasedgradually with increase of morpholine content in the samplesfrom sample M5 to M20, which is related due to the loss oftemplate trapped at ion-exchange site within CHA cage ofSAPO-34 [17]. M0 sample synthesized using TEAOH only,which showed a major phase of SAPO-5, exhibited weight lossesin three stages. The \ufb01rst stage is assigned to the desorption ofwater and the second stage with endothermic peak at around300 8C to the desorption of TEAOH and the last at temperatureranged from 370 to 800 8C is attributed to the oxidativedecomposition of TEAOH in the sample. The TGA/DTA studyindicated that complete decomposition of template occurs attemperatures greater than 550 8C hence the calcination wascarried at the said temperature during the present investigation.TPD of ammonia was used to characterize the acidicproperties of SAPO samples and curves obtained for the sameare shown in Fig. 4. Two TPD peaks for SAPO-34 samples at",

Total ammonia amount desorbed arenarrowly ranged to ca. 1.0 mmol/g for the SAPO-34 samples.The intensity of high temperature desorption peak appearing at430 8C assigned to the strong acidic sites which are generatedby the incorporation of silicon into the framework of SAPOmolecular sieve, decreased with increase of TEAOH in theorder of M20 > M15 > M10 > M5 > M0. Low temperaturepeak at ca. 200 8C, assigned to the weak acid sites which areprobably Bro\u00a8nsted acid sites originating from P-OH groups notfully linked to AlO4 tetrahedra [18], showed no apparentdifference in peak intensity with TEAOH amounts. Peakintensity of high temperature desorption peak decreased withincrease of TEAOH amount whereas Si content in productsamples increased with TEAOH amount as shown in ICP-AESresults of Table 2, which means that some part of Si in M15,M10 and M5 samples could exist as amorphous silica in extra-framework of SAPO samples and its amount could also beincreased in proportion to TEAOH amount. This observation isalso supported by XRD data in Fig. 1, where it exhibitedgradual decrease in XRD peak intensity for SAPO-34 withhigher TEAOH amount. Fig. 4(e) shows NH3-TPD pattern forM0 sample.

        "Fig. 5 shows the product distribution for methanol conversionreaction on M15 sample as a function reaction temperature. Forevery reaction temperature, the fresh catalyst was loaded tocollect the reaction data. The measurements of yield of reactionproducts in Fig. 5 correspond to a time-on-stream (TOS) of 1 h ateach temperature. At 250 8C methanol was converted mostly todimethylether (DME) with ca. 80% yield as an intermediateproduct. As the temperature increased from 300 to 500 8C, theMeOH conversion became complete and yield of light ole\ufb01ns(ethylene, propylene and butenes) was signi\ufb01cant and becamemore than 80%, whereas yield of saturated hydrocarbon wasmaintained less than 10% in whole reaction temperature. Withfurther increase of reaction temperature, C4 ole\ufb01ns gavemaximum value of about 20% at 300 8C, which graduallydecreased with increasing temperature. In the case of propylene,the yield increased with increasing temperature up to 400 8Cafterward decreased at 500 8C, whereas yield of ethylene steadilyincreased in the whole reaction temperature. The reason for thisphenomenon is that propylene and butenes can oligomerize tobigger oligomers, which crack to form ethylene at highertemperature. That is why yields of propylene and butenes havemaximum values at low or medium temperature, while the yieldof ethylene steadily increases with reaction temperature. Theethylene to propylene molar ratio increased from 0.71 at 300 8Cto 1.77 at 500 8C. Yield of ole\ufb01ns has maximum value at 450 8Cand decreases at 500 8C with increase of yield of saturatedhydrocarbon (mainly, methane).",

Catalyst deactivation on MTO reaction would mainlybe preceded by coke formation. The coke would cover acidicsites and also block the pore of SAPO-34. SAPO-34 has CHA",
        "cage (7.5 A\u02da (cid:3) 8.2 A\u02da ) enough to accommodate coke or cokeprecursor.",
        "Before catalyst deactivation the yield of ethylene increasedwith TOS and accompanied the concomitant decrease ofpropylene. The DME yield in the product steeply increasedwith start of catalyst deactivation and reached a maximum of80%. DME as a reaction intermediate can easily be converted toole\ufb01ns in acidic sites until the cages are occupied by coke. Oncethe cages are occupied by coke, yield of ole\ufb01ns is abruptlydecreased [2]. However, even after deactivation of the catalystin reaction of methanol to ole\ufb01ns, conversion reaction ofmethanol to DME can take place on the weak acidic sites ofexternal surface of SAPO-34 because this reaction can occur atweaker acidic sites than the reaction of methanol to ole\ufb01ns. Theethylene to propylene ratio reached a maximum of 1.81 justbefore the deactivation, namely at 12 h of TOS.",
        "Table 3 gives product distribution and lifetime of catalystson all the SAPO samples, which was measured in 1 h of TOS at450 8C. Allthese catalysts had complete conversion ofmethanol and mostly conversion to light ole\ufb01ns. When thereaction was conducted to give partial conversion (84%) atmuch lower temperature of 250 8C, yield of DME was 69.6%while total yield of C2\u2013C4 ole\ufb01ns was merely 12.4%. Since thecomparison of selectivity of each sample in low conversion ofmethanol would give mainly information about DME forma-tion but little information about ole\ufb01n formation, we present thedata of product distribution under the condition which givesmainly ole\ufb01ns production. M20 catalyst, synthesized withmorpholine only, shows shortest catalyst lifetime (here wede\ufb01ned \u2018catalyst lifetime\u2019 as time sustaining catalyst activityuntil total yield of C2\u2013C4 ole\ufb01ns exceeds 70%) and high yield insaturated hydrocarbons. These results may be explained bycrystal size of M20 catalyst. Big crystal can bring diffusionlimitation for reactants and products especially in small poremolecular sieve, which may result in coke formation andsubsequently deactivation of the catalyst [20].

Thissupports that catalyst lifetime strongly depends on crystal sizeof SAPO-34. The strong acidity of M20 catalyst associated withbig crystal size promoted hydrogen transfer reaction of ole\ufb01nsto saturated hydrocarbons and aromatics, which are precursorsof coke formation. The catalysts, e.g. M15, M10 and M5showed very similar product distributions with high yield inlight ole\ufb01ns. However, there was large difference in catalystlifetime. The M15 catalyst maintained activity for 840 minuntil total yield of C2\u2013C4 ole\ufb01ns maintains upper 70% (seeFig. 7). The lifetime was in order of M15 > M10 > M5 >M0 > M20. Crystal size of the samples decreases in order ofM20 > M15 > M10 as shown in SEM images of Fig. 2. We cansee that M5 sample consists of spheres of about 1 mmaggregated with nanocrystals as shown in SEM images. This isalso supported by the broadness of XRD peaks in M5 sample.Therefore, genuine crystal size decreases in order of M20 >M15 > M10 > M5. In the case of M10 and M5 samples, theyhave too short diffusion length for reaction intermediate to reactto ole\ufb01ns. Thus longest lifetime of M15 with optimum crystalsize of about 1 mm can be explained by crystal size effectbecause M20, M15, M10 and M5 samples have similar acidicproperties (Fig. 2, Table 2) and same crystal structure of CHAtopology.",

Productmolecules in SAPO-5 can be easily escaped in the pore withoutfurther reaction. Therefore, the yield of C3 and C4 ole\ufb01ns inSAPO-5 was higher as compared to SAPO-34. This result isagreement with that reported in the literature [21].",
        "Fig. 7 shows yield of light ole\ufb01ns on TOS in all the catalysts.All the catalysts except for M0 exhibited more than 90% yield inthe ole\ufb01ns with abrupt decrease on TOS by catalyst deactivation.Compared with other catalysts, M0 sample showed a slightlylower yield in ole\ufb01ns and a little slow decay in catalystdiminishment which is due to larger pore and lower acidity.",
        "4. Conclusions",
        "The variety in morphology, crystal size and structure ofSAPO catalysts can be achieved by using a mixture ofmorpholine and TEAOH as the template. When the mixture isused for the synthesis of SAPO-34, the crystal size is decreasedto sub-micrometer size and the morphology of the crystal ischanged to spherical type formed by aggregation of nano-sizedcrystals. All the prepared SAPO-34 catalysts show similaractivity and product distribution in the MTO reaction. However,the catalyst obtained using the mixture of 75% morpholine and25% TEAOH has the longest lifetime. The lifetime is increasedby \ufb01ve times compared to that of the catalyst synthesized with100% morpholine.",
